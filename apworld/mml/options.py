# Each option is its own class. options can be broken up into different categories:
# Toggle: options that are either on or off, like a hard mode or adding an item to the item pool.
# Range: options that have a mix/max value, like damage amplification, or a chance of something happening.
# Choice: an option where you pick a discrete answer like in a dropdown menu.
